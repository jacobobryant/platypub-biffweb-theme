title: Start a new project
---

[View the code for this section](https://github.com/jacobobryant/eelchat/commit/b28580129acabe01857971307be0a73f95ccd823).

As with any Biff project, we'll need to run the new project script. Important
bits (mainly, stuff you should type) are highlighted in yellow:

```plain
$ %%bb -e "$(curl -s https://biffweb.com/new-project.clj)"%%
Enter name for project directory: %%eelchat%%
Enter main namespace (e.g. com.example): %%com.eelchat%%

Your project is ready. Run the following commands to get started:

  cd eelchat
  git init
  bb dev

And run `bb tasks` for a list of available commands.
```

You'll need to
[install Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation) if you
haven't already. After your project has been created, start up the app with `bb
dev`:

```plain
$ %%cd eelchat/%%

$ %%git init%%
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/jacob/dev/eelchat/.git/

$ %%git add .%%

$ %%git commit -m "First commit"%%
[master (root-commit) 95db1ca] First commit
 22 files changed, 785 insertions(+)

$ %%bb dev%%
Downloading the latest version of Tailwind CSS...
[...]
[main] INFO com.biffweb.impl.util - %%System started.%%
[main] INFO com.eelchat - Go to http://localhost:8080
[chime-1] INFO com.eelchat.feat.worker - There are 0 users. (This message gets printed every 5 minutes. You can disable it by setting `:com.eelchat/enable-worker false` in config.edn)
nREPL server started on port 7888 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:7888
```

Once you see that "System started" message above, the application is running.
Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), then enter `hello@example.com`
into the signin form. You'll see a link printed to the terminal:

```plain

```

Open that link, and you should be signed in!

### Delete some code

New projects come with a bunch of example code for you to inspect and tinker
with. But since this is a tutorial, we'll delete most of it and start fresh. First,
let's remove the `com.eelchat.feat.worker` namespace. Remove it from `com.eelchat` first:

```diff
;; src/com/eelchat.clj
;; ...
             [com.eelchat.feat.app :as app]
             [com.eelchat.feat.auth :as auth]
             [com.eelchat.feat.home :as home]
-            [com.eelchat.feat.worker :as worker]
             [com.eelchat.schema :refer [malli-opts]]
             [clojure.java.io :as io]
             [clojure.string :as str]
;; ...
 (def features
   [app/features
    auth/features
-   home/features
-   worker/features])
+   home/features])

 (def routes [["" {:middleware [anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery
                                biff/wrap-anti-forgery-websockets
```

Then delete the `src/com/eelchat/feat/worker.clj` file.

Next, we'll go to `com.eelchat.feat.app` and delete, well, almost everything.
This file is responsible for everything you see in the screenshot above. We'll replace it
with a simple `Nothing here yet` message:

```clojure
;; src/com/eelchat/feat/app.clj
(ns com.eelchat.feat.app
  (:require [com.biffweb :as biff :refer [q]]
            [com.eelchat.middleware :as mid]
            [com.eelchat.ui :as ui]
            [xtdb.api :as xt]))

(defn app [{:keys [session biff/db] :as req}]
  (let [{:user/keys [email]} (xt/entity db (:uid session))]
    (ui/page
     {}
     nil
     [:div "Signed in as " email ". "
      (biff/form
       {:action "/auth/signout"
        :class "inline"}
       [:button.text-blue-500.hover:text-blue-800 {:type "submit"}
        "Sign out"])
      "."]
     [:.h-6]
     [:div "Nothing here yet."])))

(def features
  {:routes ["/app" {:middleware [mid/wrap-signed-in]}
            ["" {:get app}]]})
```

Go back to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and it should look like
this after you refresh the page:

Finally, let's update our schema (`com.eelchat.schema`). We'll remove the
`:msg` document and the `:user/foo` and `:user/bar` attributes, all of which
were used by the code in `com.eelchat.feat.app` which we just deleted.

```diff
;; src/com/eelchat/schema.clj
;; ...
 (def schema
   {:user/id :uuid
    :user/email :string
-   :user/foo :string
-   :user/bar :string
    :user/joined-at inst?
    :user [:map {:closed true}
           [:xt/id :user/id]
           :user/email
-          :user/joined-at
-          [:user/foo {:optional true}]
-          [:user/bar {:optional true}]]
-
-   :msg/id :uuid
-   :msg/user :user/id
-   :msg/text :string
-   :msg/sent-at inst?
-   :msg [:map {:closed true}
-         [:xt/id :msg/id]
-         :msg/user
-         :msg/text
-         :msg/sent-at]})
+          :user/joined-at]})
```

We'll keep the `:user` document and the `:user/email` and `:user/joined-at` attributes, since these
are used in `com.eelchat.feat.auth` (to handle signing up/signing in).

If you played around with the example app at all, you might already have some
`:msg` documents or `:user/foo`/`:user/bar` attributes in your database. Let's
clear out the database to ensure we don't have any non-schema-conforming
documents. Hit `Ctrl-C` in your terminal to stop the app, then run
`rm -r storage/xtdb/`. Afterward, start the app up again with `bb dev`.
