title: Background tasks

All of eelchat's core functionality is now in place. In this section, we'll add a couple
nice-to-haves: weekly digest emails and inbound RSS feeds. This will give us an excuse
to use Biff's [scheduled tasks](https://biffweb.com/docs/reference/scheduled-tasks/) and
[queues](https://biffweb.com/docs/reference/queues/).

### Work in progress

That's all for now! I've just started writing this tutorial as of
28 October 2022. I'm planning to have the first draft of it complete by the end of
November. After the tutorial is complete, I'll make videos to go along with it.
