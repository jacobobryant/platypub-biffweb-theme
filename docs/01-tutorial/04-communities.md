title: Communities
---

[View the code for this section](https://github.com/jacobobryant/eelchat/commit/bfff8fea51520b0b1ee7818865262725943c8d27).

Now that we have our landing page finished and deployed to production,
let's add all the bare-minimum essential features as quickly as we can.
This will be mostly CRUD.

We should start by thinking a bit about our **data model**. eelchat
will have at least five types of documents:

 - User
 - Community
 - Membership
 - Channel
 - Message

Users can create and join communities. A membership describes the relationship
between a user and a community: a user will have one membership document for
each community they're in, which will include things like roles. For example, a
user who creates a community will have an "admin" role in that community. A
community can have a collection of channels, and each channel can have a
collection of messages.

Go to `com.eelchat.schema` and change your schema to the following:

```clojure
(def schema
  {:user/id :uuid
   :user    [:map {:closed true}
             [:xt/id          :user/id]
             [:user/email     :string]
             [:user/joined-at inst?]]

   :comm/id   :uuid
   :community [:map {:closed true}
               [:xt/id      :comm/id]
               [:comm/title :string]]

   :mem/id     :uuid
   :membership [:map {:closed true}
                [:xt/id     :mem/id]
                [:mem/user  :user/id]
                [:mem/comm  :comm/id]
                [:mem/roles [:set [:enum :admin]]]]

   :chan/id :uuid
   :channel [:map {:closed true}
             [:xt/id      :chan/id]
             [:chan/title :string]
             [:chan/comm  :comm/id]]

   :msg/id  :uuid
   :message [:map {:closed true}
             [:xt/id          :msg/id]
             [:msg/mem        :mem/id]
             [:msg/text       :string]
             [:msg/channel    :chan/id]
             [:msg/created-at inst?]]})
```

As our application develops, we'll inevitably need to add more schema. But this
should be enough for now; no need to overthink it.

Head over to `com.eelchat.feat.app` and throw in a "New community" button:

```

Let's also tweak the default button style in `resources/tailwind.css` to match eelchat's
branding:

```


Run `bb dev`, go to `localhost:8080`, and sign in if you aren't already. Then create a community:

So far so good. We've got two application pages, one at `/app` and the other at `/community/:id`. Before we go
further, let's create a template that'll be shared between all our application pages. The template will hold
all the common elements like navigation controls and such. It could start out something like this:

![Wireframe of the application layout](/img/tutorial/layout.png)

On every page, we'll want to know the list of communities the current user is
in so that we can populate the dropdown box in the upper left corner above. Let's
modify `com.eelchat.middleware/wrap-signed-in` so it loads the user's
memberships (and the associated communities) on each request:

```

That `xt/pull` call is a little complex; you may want to read up on
[XTDB pull queries](https://docs.xtdb.com/language-reference/datalog-queries/#pull).
Let's add a `pprint` call to the community page so you can see the result of the query:

```diff

     (ui/page
      {}
```

Refresh the web page, and you should see something like this in your terminal:

```clojure
{:user/joined-at #inst "2022-11-04T22:35:13.851-00:00",
 :user/email "hello@example.com",
 :xt/id #uuid "78ccc870-df02-44a6-b224-99b36d754701",

   :xt/id #uuid "7988e233-3a9b-45e8-ab65-0914e40b01e4"})}
```

That gives us everything we need to render the application template.
Go to `com.eelchat.ui` and add an `app-page` function:

```clojure
(defn app-page [{:keys [uri user] :as opts} & body]
  (base
   opts
   [:.flex.bg-orange-50
    [:.h-screen.w-80.p-3.pr-0.flex.flex-col.flex-grow
     [:select
      {:class '[text-sm

                focus:border-teal-600
                focus:ring-teal-600]
       :onchange "window.location = this.value"}
      [:option {:value "/app"
                :selected (when (= uri "/app"))}
       "Select a community"]
      (for [{:keys [mem/comm]} (:user/mems user)
            :let [url (str "/community/" (:xt/id comm))]]
        [:option.cursor-pointer
         {:value url
          :selected (when (= url uri)
                      url)}
         (:comm/title comm)])]
     [:.grow]
     (biff/form
      {:action "/community"}
      [:button.btn.w-full {:type "submit"} "New community"])
     [:.h-3]
     [:.text-sm (:user/email user) " | "
      (biff/form
       {:action "/auth/signout"
        :class "inline"}
       [:button.text-teal-600.hover:text-teal-800 {:type "submit"}
        "Sign out"])]]
    [:.h-screen.w-full.p-3.flex.flex-col
     body]]))
```

Then use the new function in `com.eelchat.app`:

Lastly, let's make it so you can join a community that someone else has created.
Copy the URL for your community (`http://localhost:8080/community/...`) and save it somewhere.
Sign out, then sign in again with a different address. Paste the community URL into your browser.

You should see the same page as before, like the one in the screenshot above.
Let's have `com.eelchat.feat.app/community` check to see if the current user is
a member already, and if not, show a join button:
