Biff comes with a script (`setup.sh`) for setting up an Ubuntu server. It's
been tested on DigitalOcean. You can of course deploy Biff anywhere that can
run a JVM&mdash;but if you're happy with the defaults then you can simply
follow these steps:

1. Create an Ubuntu VPS in e.g. DigitalOcean.
2. (Optional) If this is an important application, you may want to set up a
   managed Postgres instance and edit `config.edn` to use that for XTDB's
   storage backend instead of the filesystem. With the default standalone
   topology, you'll need to handle backups yourself, and you can't use more
   than one server.
3. Edit `config.edn` and set `:biff.tasks/server` to the domain you'd like to
   use for your app. For now we'll assume you're using `example.com`. Also
   update `:biff/base-url`. If you use `main` instead of `master` as your
   default branch, update `:biff.tasks/deploy-from`.
4. Set an A record on `example.com` that points to your Ubuntu server.
5. Make sure you can ssh into the server, then run `scp setup.sh root@example.com:`.
6. Run `ssh root@example.com`, then `bash setup.sh`. After it finishes, run `reboot`.
7. On your local machine, run `git remote add prod ssh://app@example.com/home/app/repo.git`.

Now you can deploy your application anytime by committing your code and then
running `bb deploy`. This will copy your config files (which aren't checked
into Git) to the server, then it'll deploy the latest commit via git push. You can run
`bb logs` to make sure the deploy was successful.

Some notes:

 - See `bb tasks` for a list of other production-related commands, such as `bb prod-dev`.
 - If you need to make changes to the server (e.g. perhaps you need to install
   an additional package), be sure to update `setup.sh` so you can always
   easily provision a new server from scratch.
 - Biff is organized so you can easily split up your application into a web
   server(s) and a worker(s), although there are no step-by-step instructions
   for how to do this yet.
 - [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/) is cheap and easy to set up and is
   useful for alerts. For example, it can send you an email whenever your
   application logs include the text `Exception`.

## Developing in prod

After you've deployed at least once, you can continue developing the production
system while it's running. You'll need to install
[fswatch](https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/getting.html). (
`sudo apt install fswatch` on Ubuntu, `brew install fswatch` on Mac.) Then run
`bb prod-dev`. Whenever you save a file, it'll get copied to the server and
evaluated.
